This is the final post in the development of "DIFOU". It has been a really exciting journey,
and here you can see a gameplay video of the final product. Moreover, you can also try and play 
this game since I have added a webGL build and hosted it on Github pages.

## The gameplay

## The story 
There is a city, infested with most extraordinary zombies that can see you from far away. 
No one tried to enter this city as it would have been a suicide attempt. Well, one notable
aspect of the city is that it contains medical crates, which were dropped by the army long 
before the infection began.
Then there is Megan, a lone survivor in this harsh world. Her only protection is a submachine gun - a legacy passed down by her grandfather.
Once she got bitten when helping other survivors and now she is highly dependent on the antibiotic
vials that do extend her life. Unfortunately, those vials are scarce these days, and the only 
place it could be possbily found is exactly this city. Will she survive?

## The idea and mechanics of the game 
The idea is that you control a character named Megan. 
Your aim is to find an antibiotic vial that should be inside the red metal crates. 
If you find the crate it does not promise you that the crate will contain the vial. There is a total of 2 vials
randomly placed within those crates. Every time you start the game the placement of vials rotate randomly. The crate locations do not change though. 
The game features a navigational arrow which points to the nearest crate location.
This is done in order not to frustrate players too much while searching for those boxes on a considerably large map. 
If the vial is to be found, the game prompt player to a "win" screen where you have option to start a new game or to quit. 


## WebGL build

### The controls. 

The game was focused on Arcade machine platform, therefore there are things in game that will not make sense for PC users ðŸ˜‰

- Movement â€“ W A S D (keyboard)
- Shooting â€“ mouse left click
- Search â€“ e (keyboard)
- Jump â€“ Space
- Menu / pause menu â€“ Esc (keyboard)
- UI navigation â€“ W A S D / arrow keys / Enter

### Link to play the game:

** the "win" and "game over" UI panels in the webGL build appear faulty resized. Not sure why. The panels were made for 1080p resolution and this is only happening for webGL build. WebGl is built for 1920x1080.
