This blog post will showcase the features that were added after the project deadline.
I introduced a PC version, utilizing the mouse for aiming. Additionally, several new features and systems have been added: 

- Added 8 way locomotion.
- 8 way locomotion movement animation using blend tree
- Dynamic lighting (Day, sunset, moonlight)
- Flashlight (for player)
- Added light for light poles / flickering script
- Reload logic
- Relaod animation (custom layer and mask with avatar)
- Camera post process effect when player receives damage - red vignette.
- Adjusted navMesh and navAgent
- Added 3D Sound : gun / zombie / gore
- Zombie "knockback" upon bullet hit

There is two additional branches:
- PC_Version
- PC_Version_Meleeman (DLC)

The main branch remains unchanged and holds the original version developed within the project deadline, specifically designed for arcade machines.
